# NIR spectra and density measurements of PET yarns

A training set consisting of 21 NIR spectra of PET yarns, measured at
268 wavelengths, and 21 corresponding densities. A test set of 7 samples
is also provided. Many thanks to Erik Swierenga.

## Format

A data frame with components

- NIR:

  Numeric matrix of NIR measurements

- density:

  Numeric vector of densities

- train:

  Logical vector with `TRUE` for the training samples and `FALSE` for
  the test samples
