# Octane numbers and NIR spectra of gasoline

A data set with NIR spectra and octane numbers of 60 gasoline samples.
The NIR spectra were measured using diffuse reflectance as log(1/R) from
900 nm to 1700 nm in 2 nm intervals, giving 401 wavelengths. Many thanks
to John H. Kalivas.

## Format

A data frame with 60 observations on the following 2 variables.

- octane:

  a numeric vector. The octane number.

- NIR:

  a matrix with 401 columns. The NIR spectrum.
