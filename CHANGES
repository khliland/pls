Changes since 1.1-0:

New features:
-------------
- Line plot parameter arguments have been added to predplotXy, so one can
  control the properties of the target line in predplot.

- predict.mvr now handles missing data like predict.lm does (the default is to
  predict 'NA').

- fitted and residuals now return NA for observations with missing values,
  if na.action is na.exclude.

Bug fixes:
----------
- `ncomp' is now reduced when it is too large for the requested 
  cross-validation.

- The (optional) plot parametres "cex" and "font" were incorrectly matched
  with "cex.main" and "font.main" in predplot.

User-visible changes:
---------------------
- predict.mvr now checks the number of coloumns of newdata when it is a matrix.

Internal changes:
-----------------
- loadingplot is now generic, with a default method that handles matrices and
  objects whose loadings method return a matrix.

- A new function 'loadings'.  It is generic, with a default method that
  handles prcomp objects and anything with a "loadings" component.

- scoreplot is now generic, with a default method that handles matrices and
  objects whose scores method return a matrix.

- The prcomp method for scores has been removed.  The default method now
  handles prcomp objects as an exception.  scores also attaches the explained
  variances (if available) as the attribute "explvar".

- compnames now handles matrices as well as objects with score matrices

- explvar now also hanles score and loadings matrices

- mvr now returns a na.action component.

- new internal functions fitted.mvr, residuals.mvr and naExcludeMvr to
  handle observations with missing values.

Changes in 1.1-0
================

New features:
-------------
- mvr, mvrCv and predict.mvr now has support for scaling of X.

- A new function stdize (with predict and makepredictcall methods) for
  explicit centering and/or scaling.

- Correlation loadings plot (corrplot).

- New argument `varnames' in coefplot, to label the x tick marks with the
  variable names. 

- loadingplot now uses the `labels' argument to label x tick marks when
  'scatter = FALSE'.

- loadingplot, coefplot and plot.mvrVal can now display legends, with the
  argument 'legendpos'.

User-visible changes:
---------------------
- mvr and model.matrix.mvr now removes the prepended term name from colnames
  of X when there is only one term and it has colnames.

- The plot functions now avoid setting defaults for graphical parametres
  explicitly, wherever possible (e.g. lwd = NULL instead of lwd = 1).  That
  way, par() settings are respected.

- Most "handled" graphical parametres have been added to the formal argument
  list (for most functions: xlab and ylab).

Internal changes:
-----------------
- New functions compnames, prednames and respnames, used in plot and summary 
  functions. 

- Some minor internal changes in the plot and summary functions.

- Allows `method = "model.frame"' in mvr, plsr and pcr.

- New method model.frame.mvr.

Documentation:
--------------
- Added missing output component `Yloadings' to oscorepls.fit.Rd

- Added/fixed a couple of references.


Changes in 1.0-3
================
- mvrCv.R: Bugfix; added ^2 to R2 calculation

- predict.mvr.R: Fix handling of `newdata' such that checks of the dimensions
  of the variables found, are performed.  Also allow a matrix (without any
  checks).  In addition, a small fix for matrices without row names.

- loop revision in mvrCv.R

- Store data sets in binary form

- mvr.Rd: Added more explicit information about the formula argument.

- Numerous small clean-ups in the .Rd files


Changes in 1.0-2
================
- Added encoding information to DESCRIPTION and *.Rd
