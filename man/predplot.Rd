\arguments{
\item{object}{a fitted model.}

\item{\dots}{further arguments sent to underlying plot functions.}

\item{ncomp}{integer vector.  The model sizes (numbers of components) to use
for prediction.}

\item{which}{character vector.  Which types of predictions to plot.  Should
be a subset of \code{c("train", "validation", "test")}.  If not specified,
\code{plot.mvr} selects test set predictions if \code{newdata} is supplied,
otherwise cross-validated predictions if the model has been cross-validated,
otherwise fitted values from the calibration data.}

\item{newdata}{data frame.  New data to predict.}

\item{nCols, nRows}{integer.  The number of coloumns and rows the plots will
be laid out in.  If not specified, \code{plot.mvr} tries to be intelligent.}

\item{xlab, ylab}{titles for \eqn{x} and \eqn{y} axes.  Typically character
strings, but can be expressions or lists.  See \code{\link{title}} for
details.}

\item{main}{optional main title for the plot.  See Details.}

\item{ask}{logical.  Whether to ask the user before each page of a plot.}

\item{font.main}{font to use for main titles.  See \code{\link{par}} for
details.  Also see Details below.}

\item{cex.main}{numeric.  The magnification to be used for main titles
relative to the current size.  Also see Details below.}

\item{x}{numeric vector.  The observed response values.}

\item{y}{numeric vector.  The predicted response values.}

\item{line}{logical.  Whether a target line should be drawn.}

\item{labels}{optional.  Alternative plot labels to use.  Either a vector of
labels, or \code{"names"} or \code{"numbers"} to use the row names or row
numbers of the data as labels.}

\item{type}{character.  What type of plot to make.  Defaults to \code{"p"}
(points).  See \code{\link{plot}} for a complete list of types.  The
argument is ignored if \code{labels} is specified.}

\item{line.col, line.lty, line.lwd}{character or numeric.  The \code{col},
\code{lty} and \code{lwd} parametres for the target line.  See
\code{\link{par}} for details.}

\details{
\code{predplot} is a generic function for plotting predicted versus measured
response values, with default and \code{mvr} methods currently implemented.
The default method is very simple, and doesn't handle multiple responses or
new data.

The \code{mvr} method, handles multiple responses, model sizes and types of
predictions by making one plot for each combination.  It can also be called
through the plot method for \code{mvr}, by specifying \code{plottype =
"prediction"} (the default).

The argument \code{main} can be used to specify the main title of the plot.
It is handled in a non-standard way.  If there is only on (sub) plot,
\code{main} will be used as the main title of the plot.  If there is
\emph{more} than one (sub) plot, however, the presence of \code{main} will
produce a corresponding \sQuote{global} title on the page.  Any graphical
parametres, e.g., \code{cex.main}, supplied to \code{coefplot} will only
affect the \sQuote{ordinary} plot titles, not the \sQuote{global} one.  Its
appearance can be changed by setting the parameters with \code{\link{par}},
which will affect \emph{both} titles (with the exception of \code{font.main}
and \code{cex.main}, which will only affect the \sQuote{global} title when
there is more than one plot).  (To have different settings for the two
titles, one can override the \code{par} settings with arguments to
\code{predplot}.)

\code{predplotXy} is an internal function and is not meant for interactive
use.  It is called by the \code{predplot} methods, and its arguments, e.g,
\code{line}, can be given in the \code{predplot} call.
}
\note{
The \code{font.main} and \code{cex.main} must be (completely) named.
This is to avoid that any argument \code{cex} or \code{font} matches them.

Tip: If the labels specified with \code{labels} are too long, they get
clipped at the border of the plot region.  This can be avoided by supplying
the graphical parameter \code{xpd = TRUE} in the plot call.

\examples{

data(yarn)
mod <- plsr(density ~ NIR, ncomp = 10, data = yarn[yarn$train,], validation = "CV")
\dontrun{
predplot(mod, ncomp = 1:6)
plot(mod, ncomp = 1:6) # Equivalent to the previous
## Both cross-validated and test set predictions:
predplot(mod, ncomp = 4:6, which = c("validation", "test"),
         newdata = yarn[!yarn$train,])
}

data(oliveoil)
mod.sens <- plsr(sensory ~ chemical, ncomp = 4, data = oliveoil)
\dontrun{plot(mod.sens, ncomp = 2:4) # Several responses gives several plots}
