\arguments{
\item{object}{an \code{mvr} object; the regression to cross-validate.}

\item{segments}{the number of segments to use, or a list with segments (see
below).}

\item{segment.type}{the type of segments to use.  Ignored if \code{segments}
is a list.}

\item{length.seg}{Positive integer.  The length of the segments to use.  If
specified, it overrides \code{segments} unless \code{segments} is a list.}

\item{jackknife}{logical.  Whether jackknifing of regression coefficients
should be performed.}

\item{trace}{if \code{TRUE}, tracing is turned on.  If numeric, it denotes a
time limit (in seconds).  If the estimated total time of the
cross-validation exceeds this limit, tracing is turned on.}

\item{\dots}{additional arguments, sent to the underlying fit function.}
}
\value{
The supplied \code{object} is returned, with an additional component
\code{validation}, which is a list with components \item{method}{euqals
\code{"CV"} for cross-validation.} \item{pred}{an array with the
cross-validated predictions.} \item{coefficients}{(only if \code{jackknife}
is \code{TRUE}) an array with the jackknifed regression coefficients.  The
dimensions correspond to the predictors, responses, number of components,
and segments, respectively.} \item{PRESS0}{a vector of PRESS values (one for
each response variable) for a model with zero components, i.e., only the
intercept.} \item{PRESS}{a matrix of PRESS values for models with 1,
\ldots{}, \code{ncomp} components.  Each row corresponds to one response
variable.} \item{adj}{a matrix of adjustment values for calculating bias
corrected MSEP.  \code{MSEP} uses this.} \item{segments}{the list of
segments used in the cross-validation.} \item{ncomp}{the number of
components.} \item{gammas}{if method \code{cppls} is used, gamma values for
the powers of each CV segment are returned.}

\description{
A \dQuote{stand alone} cross-validation function for \code{mvr} objects.
}
\details{
This function performs cross-validation on a model fit by \code{mvr}.  It
can handle models such as \code{plsr(y ~ msc(X), \dots{})} or other models
where the predictor variables need to be recalculated for each segment.
When recalculation is not needed, the result of
\code{crossval(mvr(\dots{}))} is identical to \code{mvr(\dots{}, validation
= "CV")}, but slower.

Note that to use \code{crossval}, the data \emph{must} be specified with a
\code{data} argument when fitting \code{object}.

If \code{segments} is a list, the arguments \code{segment.type} and
\code{length.seg} are ignored.  The elements of the list should be integer
vectors specifying the indices of the segments.  See
\code{\link{cvsegments}} for details.

Otherwise, segments of type \code{segment.type} are generated.  How many
segments to generate is selected by specifying the number of segments in
\code{segments}, or giving the segment length in \code{length.seg}.  If both
are specified, \code{segments} is ignored.

If \code{jackknife} is \code{TRUE}, jackknifed regression coefficients are
returned, which can be used for for variance estimation
(\code{\link{var.jack}}) or hypothesis testing (\code{\link{jack.test}}).

When tracing is turned on, the segment number is printed for each segment.

By default, the cross-validation will be performed serially.  However, it
can be done in parallel using functionality in the \code{\link{parallel}}
package by setting the option \code{parallel} in \code{\link{pls.options}}.
See \code{\link{pls.options}} for the different ways to specify the
parallelism.  See also Examples below.
}
\note{
The \code{PRESS0} is always cross-validated using leave-one-out
cross-validation.  This usually makes little difference in practice, but
should be fixed for correctness.

The current implementation of the jackknife stores all jackknife-replicates
of the regression coefficients, which can be very costly for large matrices.
This might change in a future version.

\examples{

data(yarn)
yarn.pcr <- pcr(density ~ msc(NIR), 6, data = yarn)
yarn.cv <- crossval(yarn.pcr, segments = 10)
\dontrun{plot(MSEP(yarn.cv))}

\dontrun{
## Parallelised cross-validation, using transient cluster:
pls.options(parallel = 4) # use mclapply (not available on Windows)
pls.options(parallel = quote(parallel::makeCluster(4, type = "PSOCK"))) # parLapply
## A new cluster is created and stopped for each cross-validation:
yarn.cv <- crossval(yarn.pcr)
yarn.loocv <- crossval(yarn.pcr, length.seg = 1)

## Parallelised cross-validation, using persistent cluster:
library(parallel)
## This creates the cluster:
pls.options(parallel = makeCluster(4, type = "FORK")) # not available on Windows
pls.options(parallel = makeCluster(4, type = "PSOCK"))
## The cluster can be used several times:
yarn.cv <- crossval(yarn.pcr)
yarn.loocv <- crossval(yarn.pcr, length.seg = 1)
## The cluster should be stopped manually afterwards:
stopCluster(pls.options()$parallel)

## Parallelised cross-validation, using persistent MPI cluster:
## This requires the packages snow and Rmpi to be installed
library(parallel)
## This creates the cluster:
pls.options(parallel = makeCluster(4, type = "MPI"))
## The cluster can be used several times:
yarn.cv <- crossval(yarn.pcr)
yarn.loocv <- crossval(yarn.pcr, length.seg = 1)
## The cluster should be stopped manually afterwards:
stopCluster(pls.options()$parallel)
## It is good practice to call mpi.exit() or mpi.quit() afterwards:
mpi.exit()
