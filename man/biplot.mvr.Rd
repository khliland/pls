\usage{
\method{biplot}{mvr}(
  x,
  comps = 1:2,
  which = c("x", "y", "scores", "loadings"),
  var.axes = FALSE,
  xlabs,
  ylabs,
  main,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an \code{mvr} object.}

\item{comps}{integer vector of length two.  The components to plot.}

\item{which}{character.  Which matrices to plot.  One of \code{"x"} (X
scores and loadings), \code{"y"} (Y scores and loadings), \code{"scores"} (X
and Y scores) and \code{"loadings"} (X and Y loadings).}

\item{var.axes}{logical.  If \code{TRUE}, the second set of points have
arrows representing them.}

\item{xlabs}{either a character vector of labels for the first set of
points, or \code{FALSE} for no labels.  If missing, the row names of the
first matrix is used as labels.}

\item{ylabs}{either a character vector of labels for the second set of
points, or \code{FALSE} for no labels.  If missing, the row names of the
second matrix is used as labels.}

\item{main}{character.  Title of plot.  If missing, a title is constructed
by \code{biplot.mvr}.}

\item{\dots}{Further arguments passed on to \code{biplot.default}.}

\description{
Biplot method for \code{mvr} objects.
}
\details{
\code{biplot.mvr} can also be called through the \code{mvr} plot method by
specifying \code{plottype = "biplot"}.
}
\examples{

data(oliveoil)
mod <- plsr(sensory ~ chemical, data = oliveoil)
\dontrun{
## These are equivalent
biplot(mod)
plot(mod, plottype = "biplot")

## The four combinations of x and y points:
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
biplot(mod, which = "x") # Default
biplot(mod, which = "y")
biplot(mod, which = "scores")
biplot(mod, which = "loadings")
}
