\description{
Raw NIR measurements (351 wavelengths, 1100-2500 nm in steps of 4 nm) taken
on 54 samples of mayonnaise based on six different oil types (soybean,
sunflower, canola, olive, corn, and grapeseed). The resulting 54 samples
were measured in triplicates, resulting in 54 x 3 = 162 different spectra
(120/42 training/test).
