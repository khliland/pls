\arguments{
\item{object}{an \code{mvr} object.  The fitted model.}

\item{ncomp, comps}{vector of positive integers.  The components to plot.
See \code{\link{coef.mvr}} for details.}

\item{intercept}{logical.  Whether coefficients for the intercept should be
plotted.  Ignored if \code{comps} is specified.  Defaults to \code{FALSE}.
See \code{\link{coef.mvr}} for details.}

\item{separate}{logical.  If \code{TRUE}, coefficients for different model
sizes are blotted in separate plots.}

\item{se.whiskers}{logical.  If \code{TRUE}, whiskers at plus/minus 1
estimated standard error are added to the plot.  This is only available if
the model was cross-validated with \code{jackknife = TRUE}.  Also, in the
current implementation, \code{intercept} must be \code{FALSE}, and
\code{separate} must be \code{TRUE} if \code{length(ncomp) > 1}.}

\item{nCols, nRows}{integer.  The number of coloumns and rows the plots will
be laid out in.  If not specified, \code{coefplot} tries to be intelligent.}

\item{labels}{optional.  Alternative \eqn{x} axis labels.  See Details.}

\item{type}{character.  What type of plot to make.  Defaults to \code{"l"}
(lines).  Alternative types include \code{"p"} (points) and \code{"b"}
(both).  See \code{\link{plot}} for a complete list of types.}

\item{lty}{vector of line types (recycled as neccessary).  Line types can be
specified as integers or character strings (see \code{\link{par}} for the
details).}

\item{lwd}{vector of positive numbers (recycled as neccessary), giving the
width of the lines.}

\item{pch}{plot character.  A character string or a vector of single
characters or integers (recycled as neccessary).  See \code{\link{points}}
for all alternatives.}

\item{cex}{numeric vector of character expansion sizes (recycled as
neccessary) for the plotted symbols.}

\item{col}{character or integer vector of colors for plotted lines and
symbols (recycled as neccessary).  See \code{\link{par}} for the details.}

\item{legendpos}{Legend position.  Optional.  Ignored if \code{separate} is
\code{TRUE}.  If present, a legend is drawn at the given position.  The
position can be specified symbolically (e.g., \code{legendpos =
"topright"}).  This requires >= 2.1.0.  Alternatively, the position can be
specified explicitly (\code{legendpos = t(c(x,y))}) or interactively
(\code{legendpos = \link{locator}()}).  This only works well for plots of
single-response models.}

\item{xlab, ylab}{titles for \eqn{x} and \eqn{y} axes.  Typically character
strings, but can be expressions (e.g., \code{expression(R^2)} or lists.  See
\code{\link{title}} for details.}

\item{main}{optional main title for the plot.  See Details.}

\item{pretty.xlabels}{logical.  If \code{TRUE}, \code{coefplot} tries to
plot the \eqn{x} labels more nicely.  See Details.}

\item{xlim, ylim}{optional vector of length two, with the \eqn{x} or \eqn{y}
limits of the plot.}

\item{ask}{logical.  Whether to ask the user before each page of a plot.}

\item{\dots}{Further arguments sent to the underlying plot functions.}

\description{
Function to plot the regression coefficients of an \code{mvr} object.
}
\details{
\code{coefplot} handles multiple responses by making one plot for each
response.  If \code{separate} is \code{TRUE}, separate plots are made for
each combination of model size and response.  The plots are laid out in a
rectangular fashion.

If \code{legendpos} is given, a legend is drawn at the given position
(unless \code{separate} is \code{TRUE}).

The argument \code{labels} can be a vector of labels or one of
\code{"names"} and \code{"numbers"}.  The labels are used as \eqn{x} axis
labels.  If \code{labels} is \code{"names"} or \code{"numbers"}, the
variable names are used as labels, the difference being that with
\code{"numbers"}, the variable names are converted to numbers, if possible.
Variable names of the forms \samp{"number"} or \samp{"number text"} (where
the space is optional), are handled.

The argument \code{main} can be used to specify the main title of the plot.
It is handled in a non-standard way.  If there is only on (sub) plot,
\code{main} will be used as the main title of the plot.  If there is
\emph{more} than one (sub) plot, however, the presence of \code{main} will
produce a corresponding \sQuote{global} title on the page.  Any graphical
parametres, e.g., \code{cex.main}, supplied to \code{coefplot} will only
affect the \sQuote{ordinary} plot titles, not the \sQuote{global} one.  Its
appearance can be changed by setting the parameters with \code{\link{par}},
which will affect \emph{both} titles.  (To have different settings for the
two titles, one can override the \code{par} settings with arguments to
\code{coefplot}.)

The argument \code{pretty.xlabels} is only used when \code{labels} is
specified.  If \code{TRUE} (default), the code tries to use a
\sQuote{pretty} selection of labels.  If \code{labels} is \code{"numbers"},
it also uses the numerical values of the labels for horisontal spacing.  If
one has excluded parts of the spectral region, one might therefore want to
use \code{pretty.xlabels = FALSE}.

When \code{separate} is \code{TRUE}, the arguments \code{lty}, \code{col},
and \code{pch} default to their \code{par()} setting.  Otherwise, the
default for all of them is \code{1:nLines}, where \code{nLines} is the
number of model sizes specified, i.e., the length of \code{ncomp} or
\code{comps}.

The function can also be called through the \code{mvr} plot method by
specifying \code{plottype = "coefficients"}.
}
\note{
\code{\link{legend}} has many options.  If you want greater control
over the appearance of the legend, omit the \code{legendpos} argument and
call \code{legend} manually.

The handling of \code{labels} and \code{pretty.xlabels} is experimental.
