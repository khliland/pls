\description{
Functions to estimate the mean squared error of prediction (MSEP), root mean
squared error of prediction (RMSEP) and \eqn{R^2} (A.K.A. coefficient of
multiple determination) for fitted PCR and PLSR models.  Test-set,
cross-validation and calibration-set estimates are implemented.
}
\details{
\code{RMSEP} simply calls \code{MSEP} and takes the square root of the
estimates.  It therefore accepts the same arguments as \code{MSEP}.

Several estimators can be used.  \code{"train"} is the training or
calibration data estimate, also called (R)MSEC.  For \code{R2}, this is the
unadjusted \eqn{R^2}.  It is overoptimistic and should not be used for
assessing models.  \code{"CV"} is the cross-validation estimate, and
\code{"adjCV"} (for \code{RMSEP} and \code{MSEP}) is the bias-corrected
cross-validation estimate.  They can only be calculated if the model has
been cross-validated.  Finally, \code{"test"} is the test set estimate,
using \code{newdata} as test set.

Which estimators to use is decided as follows (see below for
\code{mvrValstats}).  If \code{estimate} is not specified, the test set
estimate is returned if \code{newdata} is specified, otherwise the CV and
adjusted CV (for \code{RMSEP} and \code{MSEP}) estimates if the model has
been cross-validated, otherwise the training data estimate.  If
\code{estimate} is \code{"all"}, all possible estimates are calculated.
Otherwise, the specified estimates are calculated.

Several model sizes can also be specified.  If \code{comps} is missing (or
is \code{NULL}), \code{length(ncomp)} models are used, with \code{ncomp[1]}
components, \ldots{}, \code{ncomp[length(ncomp)]} components.  Otherwise, a
single model with the components \code{comps[1]}, \ldots{},
\code{comps[length(comps)]} is used.  If \code{intercept} is \code{TRUE}, a
model with zero components is also used (in addition to the above).

The \eqn{R^2} values returned by \code{"R2"} are calculated as \eqn{1 -
SSE/SST}, where \eqn{SST} is the (corrected) total sum of squares of the
response, and \eqn{SSE} is the sum of squared errors for either the fitted
values (i.e., the residual sum of squares), test set predictions or
cross-validated predictions (i.e., the \eqn{PRESS}).  For \code{estimate =
"train"}, this is equivalent to the squared correlation between the fitted
values and the response.  For \code{estimate = "train"}, the estimate is
often called the prediction \eqn{R^2}.

\code{mvrValstats} is a utility function that calculates the statistics
needed by \code{MSEP} and \code{R2}.  It is not intended to be used
interactively.  It accepts the same arguments as \code{MSEP} and \code{R2}.
However, the \code{estimate} argument must be specified explicitly: no
partial matching and no automatic choice is made.  The function simply
calculates the types of estimates it knows, and leaves the other untouched.

\section{Value}{
 \code{mvrValstats} returns a list with components \describe{
\item{SSE}{three-dimensional array of SSE values.  The first dimension is
the different estimators, the second is the response variables and the third
is the models.} \item{SST}{matrix of SST values.  The first dimension is the
different estimators and the second is the response variables.}
\item{nobj}{a numeric vector giving the number of objects used for each
estimator.} \item{comps}{the components specified, with \code{0} prepended
if \code{intercept} is \code{TRUE}.} \item{cumulative}{\code{TRUE} if
\code{comps} was \code{NULL} or not specified.} }

The other functions return an object of class \code{"mvrVal"}, with
components \describe{ \item{val}{three-dimensional array of estimates.  The
first dimension is the different estimators, the second is the response
variables and the third is the models.} \item{type}{\code{"MSEP"},
\code{"RMSEP"} or \code{"R2"}.} \item{comps}{the components specified, with
\code{0} prepended if \code{intercept} is \code{TRUE}.}
\item{cumulative}{\code{TRUE} if \code{comps} was \code{NULL} or not
specified.} \item{call}{the function call} }
